# NCAA-Tournament-Challenge-Bracket-Simulator
This is a Python script that uses men's college basketball data from 2013-2019 and the Bracketology package to simulate bracket outcomes. 
The data is used when creating the algorithm that picks game winners as they progress through the tournament. Results of the program show:
expected winner vs. the actual winner, points earned out of 1920, and the expected final matchup vs. the actual final matchup.
